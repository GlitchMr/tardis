'TARDIS' (or 'Tardis', or 'tardis') is the working name given to something
that a few of us hope will eventually blossom out into a time-travelling
debugger. The capital letters may give the false impression that it's an
acronym for something -- but it isn't unless you count the original sense
from Dr Who.

For an attempt at a technical discussion on time-travelling debugging, see
docs/theory.
